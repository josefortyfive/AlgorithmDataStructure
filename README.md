# Algorithm and DataStructure

Algorithm and Data Structure helps the program efficiently. There's a lot of Algorithm that has been invented and designed.
Many programs uses these Algorithm and Data Structure for their program whether if it's small, medium or large enterprise.
I use this repository for practice only and documentation purposes. Please refer to this file for reference to know more about the topic.

* Sorting
* Search
* Recursion


## Data Structure
